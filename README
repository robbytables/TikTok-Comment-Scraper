# TikTok Comment Scraper

This script is used to scrape comments and their replies from a list of TikTok videos. This is purely for research use, not for any business or monetary purposes.


## Getting Started

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

```
python3 -m venv ttscrape
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Running the script is easy- just `python3 ttscrape.py`

To test scraping a URL without writing to file, you can provide a single URL when prompted.

Otherwise, use the `tiktok_urls.csv` file to list all URLs of videos you want scraped.
